a) What is the difference between Internal Storage & External Storage?
 Internal Storage: 
             * Internal storage is also known as primary memory and is In built storage
             * Internal storage is inside the system Memory, is used to store the operation system, system apps, and other app data
             * Files saved to the internal storage are private to our application and other applications cannot access them  
             * Internal storage refers to the media usually Hard Drives and is connected to the computer power supply.   
   External Storage:
             * External  storage is also known as secondary memory and is removable storage.
             * External storage is not part of a computer's main memory or storage, hence it is called secondary or auxiliary storage.
             * It can be used as a backup, to store achieved information or to transport data.
             * External storage can be used to save media files such as pictures, music, videos while most applications can not be installed on external storage.
             * External storage devices are commonly available in the form of flash drives, USB drives, CDs and DVDs.

b) For how long the data resides in the cache?

1.Typically files will stay in the cache until space runs out.
		2.it's also a matter of how much each person browses.
		3.If a cache refresh is needed, we can force the page to not cache files.

c) What are the critical Permissions and Normal Permissions? What are the examples of each?
  
Normal Permission : Normal permissions cover areas where your app needs to access data or resources outside the app's sandbox, but where there's very little risk to the user's privacy or the operation of other apps. 
	                 For example, permission to set the time zone is a normal permission. 
	                  If an app declares that it needs a normal permission, the system automatically grants the permission to the app. 
Example for Normal Permission are : Access_Location_Extra_Commands,Access_Network_State,Access_Notification_Policy,Access_Wifi_State,Bluetooth.

 Critical Permissions: Critical permissions are also declared in manifest file,from Android 6.0 only critical permissions are checked at runtime.these give an application access to the user’s private data or affect the system and other apps.
                     If we list a criticalpermission in manifest, then the user has to explicitly give permission to your application.  
                     the ability to read the user's contacts is a dangerous permission. If an app declares that it needs a dangerous permission, 
		     the user has to explicitly grant the permission to the app. 
                     example of a dangerous permission is CAMERA,READ_CONTACTS,ADD_VOICEMAIL,USE_SIP,PROCESS_OUTGOING_CALLS
